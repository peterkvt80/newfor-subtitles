1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,160
Oh. You're early.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,988
Or I'm late. (LAUGHS)

3
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:14,539
Either way, hello. I'm glad you're here.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,519
Let me, uh, get you caught up to speed.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,060
Earlier in the week, my mother
came to me in a panic.

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,070
Katharine?!

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,479
Mom, you scared the tea out of me.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,360
Tara's renewing her vows.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,904
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,239
Why wouldn't I be okay?

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,288
Because your best friend's
getting two weddings,

12
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:35,588
and you've never had one.

13
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:37,699
(WHISPERING): And you're 39.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,500
(WHISPERING): Why are we whispering?

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,090
Oh. (LAUGHS)

16
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:44,380
Thought I had more time.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,819
My mother's been extra worried
about my single status

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,633
since my father died, which
was super hard on both of us.

19
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,719
- (CRYING)
- (CRYING): I want to go to sleep

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,038
and never wake up.

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,880
I think I want to open a cat café.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,760
So, I did.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,889
I quit my unfulfilling job
as a math professor,

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,879
and I opened Kat's Cat Café,

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,359
where I have two great employees
who are super helpful.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,345
Whoever thinks of a good
name for our new cat

27
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:12,739
- gets an extra paid sick day.
- (BOTH GASP)

28
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,539
Oh! Uh, how about "Pudding,"

29
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,284
'cause I could just eat
him with a spoon?

30
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:20,200
How about "Firework," 'cause it
looks like one exploded in his ass?

31
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,689
- Ooh! I like that.
- That's pretty good.

32
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,707
Yeah?

33
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,353
I think he's purr-fect.

34
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:26,919
Now on with our show.

35

This is so good, Phil. What am I eating?

39
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,543
Well, my mama used to make it
for us kids on the holidays.

40
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,999
We thought the burnt
coconut looked like hair,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,732
so we called it "Mama's Hairy Pie."

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,020
Put it on the menu, but
let's change the name.

43
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,359
Hey, Kat, this came for you.

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,819
Mm! This is the invitation

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,360
to my friend Tara's
renewal-of-vows ceremony.

46
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,719
Wait. My RSVP card says "Ms.
Katharine Edith Silver and,"

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,199
and then there's this line.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,750
Does that mean I get a plus-one?

49
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,961
- Looks like it.
- (GASPS) This is so exciting!

50
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,829
I never get a plus-one.

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,740
They're withheld from single
people like a public shaming.

52
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,819
Since you're not dating anybody,
you should just go alone

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,108
and have fun flirting with all
the single men at the party.

54
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,213
That's one of my favorite games.

55
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:22,299
I call it "Catch and Release."

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,979
Well, you obviously don't live
with social anxiety like I do.

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,086
Did I tell you a guy got
into my car yesterday,

58
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,459
thinking it was an Uber?

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,959
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,180
so I just drove him all
the way to the airport.

61
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,119
Ooh, it says the reception will be held

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,439
in the Crystal Ballroom
at The Brown Hotel.

63
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,919
Ooh, The Brown is the most
iconic hotel in Louisville.

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,189
Elizabeth Taylor lost an emerald

65
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,835
out of her peacock
broach there one time.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,369
- Phil, are okay?
- I'm...

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,539
No, I... I'm sorry.

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,659
It's just that Marty's work party
was supposed to be there,

69
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,553
and I was so excited about
dancing at the Crystal Ballroom.

70
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,344
But then he came home and said

71
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,659
he'd met that young buck at Big Lots!

72
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,185
Who sold him a broom and
swept him off his feet.

73
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,854
I'm so sorry, Phil.

74
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,733
It's my own fault. I asked
him to buy the broom.

75
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,694
I hate seeing people sad.

76
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,237
They look like wounded baby birds.

77
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,348
I just want to tape a little Popsicle
stick to that broken wing.

78
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,908
Here I go.

79
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,454
- Phil?
- Huh?

80
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,123
Would you do me the honor
of being my plus-one?

81
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,123
Get out of town.
Are you kidding me, Kat?

82
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,499
Nope. Not kidding.
And we'll have a lot more fun

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,069
than you would've had
at a stupid work party

84
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,713
'cause this is a stupid
renewing-their-vows ceremony.

85
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:38,679
- Plus, you'll be with me.
- Oh, thank you, Kat.

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,959
Can I call my mama and tell her

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,388
I'm going to the Crystal Ballroom?

88
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,181
- Of course.
- (LAUGHING): Oh!

89
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,391
Hey, Mama, guess what.

90
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,720
Gosh, I wonder what it's like
to be excited to call your mom.

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,050
One root beer, please.

92
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,153
I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,039
Not the first time that's happened.

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,620
Due to my low, resonant voice,

95
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,599
I often get mistaken for
a man on the phone.

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,540
And once on video chat.

97
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,357
Oh, I am so sorr...

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,330
Kat?

99
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,542
Max?

100
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,044
- (LAUGHS)
- No way!

101
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,249
Hot Max?

102
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,519
Oh.

103
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,860
That was meant for you.

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,260
So, how are you? What are
you doing with your life?

105
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,629
I just got back into town,
and Carter gave me a job

106
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,763
so I'd have an answer
to questions like that.

107
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,779
Hey, do not let her behind the bar.

108
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,683
She likes to play with the soda gun.

109
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:31,739
(LAUGHS) I wasn't playing with it.

110
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,394
I was inventing a new drink.

111
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,940
I don't go to your café
and invent new cats.

112
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,979
You know what list you're on.

113
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,220
It's not a good list.

114
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,073
So what's going on with you?

115
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,460
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm meeting Tara
here to discuss her wedding.

116
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,779
Her second wedding to her first husband.

117
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,123
I think she might be a wedding hoarder.

118
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,583
So, are you married?

119
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,794
Yeah. Yes, of course.

120
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,499
Oh, cool. You have kids?

121
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,679
Yeah, I got two of those rascals.

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,593
There's Orlando and, uh, Bloom.

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,239
This is what I was talking about.

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,597
(WHISPERING): This is social anxiety.

125
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,659
What about you?

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,892
- No, not married.
- Yeah, me neither.

127
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,644
You just said you were.

128
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,313
Divorced now. No kids.

129
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,857
What happened to the kids?

130
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,652
(LAUGHING): Well, that's
a funny story, Max.

131
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,179
Not funny "Ha, ha."

132
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,339
Funny in that it is almost unbelievable.

133
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,799
- Oh.
- We were, um, on vacation

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
in the Himalayas,

135
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,339
and they were just running
around in shorts and T-shirts.

136
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,819
And I kept saying, "You're
gonna freeze to death."

137
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,419
And they... did.

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,669
Fake kids at that age.

139
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,359
I lobbed it, and he hit it right back.

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,719
I am unmarried, and I live
alone above my cat café,

141
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,140
which is a... a lot sexier
than it sounds.

142
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,259
Yeah, it's really good to see you, Kat.

143
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,122
Oh, will you excuse me for a sec?

144
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,813
(DOOR OPENS)

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,640
KAT: Mm.

146
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,564
Tara, Tara, Tara, Tara, guess what?

147
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,278
Look, we can keep arguing,
or you can just agree with me.

148
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,879
Wise choice. Okay, I'll call you later.

149
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,490
Hey, Kitty Kats. So sorry.
What were you saying?

150
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,284
Max is back, and he's here!

151
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,989
Ooh!

152
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,560
It's Max from college! (LAUGHS)

153
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,839
Hey, wait. Didn't you
have a crush on him?

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,119
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

155
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,679
Of course I did.

156
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,882
Everyone did, 'cause...
well, look at him.

157
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,289
Well, fun!

158
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,079
Anyway, Katnip, I got your RSVP,

159
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,460
and I am so excited
you're bringing someone.

160
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,659
So, fill me in on this Phil Crumpler...

161
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,420
who must be filling you in.

162
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,980
She can be disgusting.

163
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,460
Phil's my new baker. And a friend.

164
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,526
We just started a culinary arts club.

165
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,179
It'll keep his little stem warm.

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,279
Oh.

167
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,899
Listen, if Phil's just a friend,
you can't bring him.

168
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,739
The Brown Hotel is very expensive,

169
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,913
and we didn't really
budget for extra guests.

170
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:57,119
But if I were to go on say,
GettingLuckyinKentucky.com,

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,859
and randomly invited someone
to be my date to your event,

172
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,129
you'd be fine paying for their meal?

173
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,519
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Plus-one's are someone

174
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,841
- you've been dating for a while.
- Well, for how long?

175
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,439
Well, you know, when you're
at that point in a relationship

176
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,419
where instead of saying, "Hey,
what are you doing this weekend?,"

177
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,929
you say, "Hey, what are<i>
we</i> doing this weekend?"

178
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,179
Yeah, that point in your relationship

179
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,659
where you stop calling
her by her first name

180
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,249
and starting call her "Boo-Boo."

181
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,648
- Exactamundo.
- Oh.

182
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,579
When is that? I mean, I feel
like that must be different

183
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,651
for everybody.

184
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,100
- Four months.
- Four months.

185
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,613
Thank you so much, Carter.

186
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,657
You're welcome so much, Kat.

187
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,919
Well, maybe there could
be a little wiggle room

188
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,299
about who I bring considering

189
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,039
this is a renewal-of-vows ceremony.

190
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,039
It's not an actual wedding.

191
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,479
Oh, Kat, you know that I've
been planning my wedding

192
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,519
since I was eight years old,
and then it actually rained

193
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,099
on my wedding day, so
then I started planning

194
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,299
my renewing-my-vows
ceremony on my honeymoon.

195
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,329
I just want this to be perfect.

196
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,509
Okay, I will come alone.

197
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,179
Thanks for understanding, Katnip.

198
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,509
Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

199
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,059
Now, onto more important things.
What are you gonna wear?

200
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,180
Please tell me you're not gonna
wear the green pantsuit.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,319
I got this pantsuit seven years ago,

202
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,439
and I've worn it to every
fancy event since,

203
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,499
and that includes National Donut Day,

204
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,075
as in "Do-not forget my pantsuit." Boom!

205
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,260
I've just never been
obsessed with fashion.

206
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,719
And I don't appreciate those shows

207
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,119
where "fashion experts"
accost people on the street

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
and tell them how hideous they look.

209
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,819
If I had one of those shows,

210
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,834
I'd call it <i>Wear What You Want!</i>

211
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:27,215
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.
Do you like what you're wearing?

212
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,579
- Yeah.
- Are you comfortable?

213
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,589
Yeah.

214
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,637
Do you care that other
people might not like it?

215
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,307
- No.
- Great. Wear what you want!

216
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,559
Seriously, this pantsuit
is so comfortable,

217
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,609
and it is so stretchy, I can do this.

218
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,109
And even this.

219
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,600
Whoa! Geez. I am so sorry!

220
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,819
Oh. Phil,

221
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,991
I have to talk to you.
I am really sorry...

222
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,480
Wait. I need to show you something.

223
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,989
(CHUCKLES) For your friend's ceremony.

224
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,599
I saw it winking at me
in women's petites,

225
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,419
and needless to say, I winked back.

226
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,939
Well, be careful, Phil.

227
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,467
You might make that
Crystal Ballroom jealous.

228
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,039
Oh, for the first time in a long while,

229
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,849
I feel like my old self, Kat,
and all that is thanks to you.

230
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,099
So, what'd you need to tell me?

231
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,930
Uh... I forget.

232
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,349
But you look great.

233
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,689
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Yeah.

234
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,080
Don't look at me like that.
I'll think of something.

235
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,880
(GASPS) I thought of something.

236
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,859
Well, you caught me
off guard today, Tara,

237
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,909
but I do need to tell you that...

238
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,640
Phil Crumpler and I
actually are a couple,

239
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,760
and we've been keeping
it on the Down Low,

240
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,918
'cause, you know, he is
quite a bit older than me.

241
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,079
Uh, yeah, well, it's, uh,
been about five months.

242
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,160
(WHISPERING): Four months
seemed too on the nose.

Thank you.

255
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,000
Katharine, why is Phil here?

256
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,260
Hmm. I brought him.

257
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,760
As my plus-one, because,
you know, he's my boyfriend.

258
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,849
He's your what?

259
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,630
My boyfriend.

260
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,388
You know how when you
have a friend who's a girl

261
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,168
and you're really close,
you call her your girlfriend?

262
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,399
Well, Phil and I have
gotten really close,

263
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
so I call him my boyfriend.

264
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,580
So, if anybody asks, you can just say,

265
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,569
"Yup, there's Kat and her boyfriend."

266
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,260
Ooh, I need a drink.
Do you want one... girlfriend?

267
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,779
I think you've had too much.

268
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,989
No. No, that's quite enough.

269
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,188
- You can't handle it.
- Give it to me.

270
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,190
- I don't think you should...
- Mom, stop. (GASPS)

271
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,250
My pantsuit!

272
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,410
MAX: Kat?

273
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,919
Max?

274
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,550
(MOUTHING)

275
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,839
What are you doing here?

276
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,290
When Cole heard I was back
in town, he invited me.

277
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,509
I don't know if you remember,

278
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,309
but Cole and I used
to play ball together.

279
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,889
Yeah, I remember you two
playing with your balls.

280
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,980
Oh, and now I'd like to
buy that sentence back

281
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,640
with an invisible dollar, sir.

282
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,150
And I will take that invisible dollar

283
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,230
- and put it in my pocket.
- (CHUCKLES)

284
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,140
Speaking of remembering...

285
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,468
I remember you were only supposed

286
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,250
to teach English overseas for a year,

287
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,779
and that was, like, ten years ago.

288
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,150
That is true.

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,659
And then, I started doing
some traveling, and...

290
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,829
(BRITISH ACCENT): Did you go to Narnia?

291
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,950
What? Why? Was... ?

292
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,490
Close. I met a girl in Paris.

293
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,160
(FRENCH ACCENT): I am sorry
I took so long, <i>Mon Lapin.</i>

294
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,360
There was a little woman
handing out towels

295
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,219
to dry our hands in the<i> toilette.</i>

296
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,220
So I had her take a
series of photos of me

297
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,410
applying my lipstick for my blog.

298
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,849
(ECHOING): Hello.

299
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,639
MAX: So we're taking some time apart.

300
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,019
I'm sorry. What?

301
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,859
Brigitte and I broke up.

302
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,060
So, came home for a
while to clear my head.

303
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,350
And my arteries.

304
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,859
They dip cheese in cheese there.

305
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,480
I thought I invented that.

306
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,730
- Oh.
- Hi, Max.

307
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,620
- Hey.
- Cole's looking for you.

308
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,360
Hi! Hey, Kitty Kats.

309
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,780
I see you hanging out with
Max instead of your boyfriend.

310
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,790
Well, that's because...

311
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,839
Because Phil's not your boyfriend.

312
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,660
(LAUGHS)

313
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,320
Yes, he is.

314
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,460
I mean, didn't you see us
out on the dance floor?

315
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,860
Do you know why we're that good?

316
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,410
Sexual chemistry.

317
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,220
I can't believe you'd lie to me, Kat.

318
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,900
- We grew up together.
- (SIGHS)

319
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,810
(QUIETLY): We played doctor together.

320
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,710
Yes, which is why I know your heart.

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,780
And even though your mouth said,

322
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,308
"You can't bring a
friend to this wedding,"

323
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,190
what I heard your heart say was,

324
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,279
"Sure, you can bring
a friend! I'm chill."

325
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,960
I had our initials engraved
in the butter pats.

326
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,040
Does that sound chill to you?

327
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,640
Fine. You know what?

328
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,160
How about I write you a
check for Phil's salmon?

329
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,200
He didn't finish it, by the way.

330
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,299
It was fishy.

331
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,600
(GASPS)

332
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,268
You know what? I don't
want to make a scene here.

333
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,260
So, you win, Kat. You win.

334
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,850
(SCOFFS)

335
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,600
She rents this hall,

336
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,300
she wears a big white stupid dress,

337
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,730
she invites 200 people,

338
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,760
but she doesn't want
to make a scene? Okay.

339
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh. (GASPS)

340
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,350
My pantsuit!

341
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,490
Again?!

342
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,240
This is all my fault.

343
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,790
No, it's Tara's fault for
being so controlling

344
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,739
and not cutting me a little slack.

345
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,060
Right after her C-section,

346
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,829
when she wasn't allowed
to have food yet,

347
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,749
who did she ask to sneak her
in a whole rotisserie chicken?

348
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,240
- You?
- Me.

349
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,930
And I did it, right under my shirt.

350
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,000
It burned me a little.

351
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,600
But if I hadn't been such a complainer

352
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,770
about Marty not taking
me to his work party,

353
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,010
you wouldn't have felt
like you had to bring me.

354
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,290
I didn't feel like I had to.

355
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,400
I felt like I deserved
the same opportunity

356
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,559
as other guests to bring a plus-one.

357
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,180
I wanted a designated dance partner.

358
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,918
I wanted to bring someone
I could gossip with

359
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,190
about how much everybody drank

360
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,870
and who's freezing the fat off their ass

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
and injecting it into their face.

362
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,490
- That woman Lisa!
- Thank you. Whew!

363
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,409
I went to Tara's first wedding alone.

364
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,340
My dance choices were a priest

365
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,579
or a grabby little
eight-year-old named Dustin.

366
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,790
It's hard being single, isn't it?

367
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,530
It can be.

368
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,820
But here's the thing.

369
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,200
I love my life.

370
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,210
I love my job.

371
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,510
I love my friends.

372
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,950
But, yeah, there are times

373
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,880
when doing things alone
can be a little lonely.

374
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,050
I get that.

375
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,730
When Marty first left, I thought,

376
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,230
"Well, at least the house stays clean."

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,510
But it was so quiet.

378
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,079
Too quiet.

379
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,480
When I came into your café that day,

380
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,890
you said, "Welcome! I like your shirt."

381
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,750
- (CHUCKLES)
- And I said, "Thank you."

382
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,390
I remember that because
you were the first person

383
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,339
I had talked to in two weeks.

384
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm glad you came in that day.

385
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,150
Me, too.

386
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,700
I don't think you should
be too upset with Tara.

387
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,170
She got three kids.

388
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,870
And her husband's one
of them loud talkers.

389
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,190
I bet she'd love to
switch places with you

390
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,940
and be alone for a while.

391
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,190
When I sprained both my
wrists trying to do parkour,

392
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,280
- she did brush my teeth for me.
- (PHIL CHUCKLES)

393
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,930
Where you going?

394
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,038
I'm gonna go apologize to Tara

395
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,380
before she leaves for
her second honeymoon.

396
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,220
Oh. (MUTTERS)

397
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,460
I am just so glad that you two made up.

398
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,258
Well, it helped that when
I ran into the street

399
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,139
to chase her down, I got clipped
by her Just-Married-Again limo.

400
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,510
- It put her in a very forgiving mood.
- (CHUCKLES)

401
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,010
(PHONE RINGS)

402
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,309
Oh, it's my mama. Can I take a break?

403
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,510
Go for it.

404
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,350
Hi, Mama.

405
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,060
Phil has been waiting for his
mama to get out of Bible study

406
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,930
so he can tell her all about
his night at The Brown Hotel.

407
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,619
I've never seen him so happy.
Good on you, Kat.

408
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,070
Thanks, Randi.

409
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,369
But you don't need to call me a hero.

410
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm not a hero.

411
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,240
Yeah, I didn't say that.

412
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,200
But just to catch you up on
what I've been dealing with.

413
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,459
Purr-tricia has organized
a small kitty gang,

414
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,800
and they keep trapping
Firework in the cat basket.

415
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,090
And, hey, look at the time.
That is no longer my problem.

416
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,390
I will take Firework upstairs

417
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,270
until Purr-tricia's new owners
pick her up tomorrow.

418
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,870
It never ceases to amaze me how
the mean girls get picked first.

419
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,230
Yes, they do. I know.

420
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,118
- (MEOWS)
- Yeah, I know. You did the right thing.

421
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,740
You turned the other cheek.

422
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,230
(MEWING)

423
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,279
Hello, Katharine.

424
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
Oh. (MUTTERS)

425
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,980
Geez, Mom.

426
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,440
You scared the cat out of me.

427
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,320
What were you thinking,

428
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,200
calling that man your boyfriend?

429
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,709
You're too young to be so eccentric.

430
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,370
What can I say? I wanted
to take Phil so I took Phil.

431
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,379
I had friends there.

432
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,799
Ladies from the Junior League,
girls from the pageant circuit.

433
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,340
(GASPS) Not the girls
from the pageant circuit.

434
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,469
Did Miss Muhlenberg County take notice?

435
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,990
She certainly did.

436
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,020
Even with a glass eye, she
could tell something was amiss.

437
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,189
Look, I'm sorry I embarrassed
you in front of your friends.

438
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,110
I'm not that sorry, but I'll throw
her a bone on that one.

439
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,570
There is no road map of
how I should live my life

440
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,369
as a 39-year-old single woman, Mom.

441
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,490
So I'm just gonna have to
make it up as I go along.

442
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,750
And as you have witnessed,
it's gonna be kind of messy.

443
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,169
But also kind of awesome,

444
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,250
'cause did you see me and
Phil out there line dancing?

445
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
I mean, we were by far the best ones.

446
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,190
Oh, honey, I'm just worried

447
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,510
that you're not trying to meet someone.

448
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,929
I mean, aren't you afraid
of becoming a sad cat lady?

449
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,600
Not a chance.

450
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,400
- I'm gonna be a rad cat lady.
- (MEWS)

451
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,040
And now, Mom,

452
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,900
now that I've answered your questions,

453
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,550
I have a question for you.

454
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,940
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?

455
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,990
Drifting through the wind?

456
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,540
Wanting to start again?

457
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,280

- Yeah. Would you?
- Sure.

474
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,559
Oh. Do you want me on the
inside or the outside of it?

Inside.

477
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,060
Cool. I was just leaving the bar

478
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,600
and I saw your light on and I thought

479
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,939
maybe you'd want to grab some dinner.

480
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,620
Just to catch up.

Just two old friends catching up.

Yeah, I want to grab dinner.

483
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,079
I want to grab it by the meatballs.

(LAUGHS) Oh!

485

What am I saying, Max?

486

I'm not sure.

487
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,160
Let me just go upstairs and
change into something nicer.

488
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,320
Why?

489

'Cause I just threw this on for work.

Are you comfortable?

Do you care what other
people think of you?

Then let's go.
